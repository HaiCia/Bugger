Crazy bugs - Arcade Game


# Description: 

Front-end Nanodegree Udacity Project. The goal is to move the character from 'grass' on the bottom row to 'water' on top avoiding collision with bugs 10 times. There are 3 lives provided marked as hearts just over the right top corner of the game canvas and player level on the left side. 

## How to play:

To start download files and open index.html in a browser.

To choose character just double click on the character.

By using arrows keys on a keyboard, the character is moving side to side and top to bottom. Each time character touches the Bug one of the lives is gone. After 3-rd and 7-th time character reach 'water' difficulty is changing, last three levels are really hard. Enjoy.

### Dependencies: 

All files and images were provided by Udacity, my job was to make it run. I used plain JavaScript and add a smaller version of heart.png.
