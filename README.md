Crazy bugs - Arcade Game


# Description: 

Front-end Nanodegree Udacity Project. The goal is to move character from 'grass' on the bottom row to 'water' on top avoiding any collision with bugs 10 times. There is 3 lifes provided marked as hearts just over right top corner of game canvas and player level on left side. 

## How to play:

To start download files and open index.html in browser.

To choose character just double click on character.

By using arrows keys on keybord character is moving side to side and top to bottom. Each time character touch the Bug one of the lives is gone. after 3-rd and 7-th time character reach 'water' difficulty is changing, last three levels are really hard. Enjoy!

### Dependencies: 

All files and images was provided by Udacity, my job was make it run. I used plain JavaScript and add smaller version of heart.png.
